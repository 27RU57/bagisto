Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json to its original content.


**Solution**
 You need to your laravel framework  version using commond 
        ``` laravel --version ```

After that if you find the latest version or old version you need to install ui,if find error like this

[UnexpectedValueException]
Could not parse version constraint '1.0': Invalid version string "'1.0'"

 For this you need to change the command 

  ```composer require laravel/ui "^1.0" --dev -vv```
#Authentication Error
 
     ```php artisan ui vue --auth```
 
   Got this Error

      copy(C:\pro\bagisto\resources\sass/_variables.scss): failed to open stream: No such file or directory

**Solution**
For correcting this error we need to follow some steps-:
1. You need to go to your Bigisto Directory
2. Now move to 
    **Resource** folder-->
3. Move to 
        **Assets** folder-->
4. Copy the two folders
        **js** folder and **sass** folder
5. Paste the both copied folder into Resource folder.
           
  Final Step ,try the same command
    ```php artisan ui vue --auth```
